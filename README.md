Men 6 Nations Rugby statistics.

The files contain the statistics collected through various methods (manual collection and web scraping from public sources) of publicly available data from different sources (Official 6 Nations website, ESPN, Wikipedia and other) about the statistics for each team in the tournament and each player of the teams.
The collected data has been separated in different tables:
- TEAM_YEAR_STATS : general yearly statistics of each team (2020-2025)
- TEAM_MATCH_STATS : more in-depth statistics of each match in the tournament (2020-2025)
- PLAYER_STATS : general statistics of each player that has played at least one match from 2020 to 2025; the data itself is general and includes statistics form the entire international carreer
- PLAYER_MATCH_STATS : in-depth statistics of each match in the torunament for each player (2020-2025)

The collected data is as accurate as possible, but inconsistencies may occur as the data itself is publicly available and the methods for its original collection is not known. Also, the collected data comes from different sources and while steps have been taken to ensure as much consistency between the table as possible, it can not be completely guaranteed.

The project is on-going and might be updated with more tables if needed.
